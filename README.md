<strike>This system isn't fully complete. The only class that isn't fully functional is the Database class. Everything else should work properly</strike>

This is essentially a text manipulation program. It takes in a text file that's formatted to look like a table. 
Then through the program it will give you the ability to manipulate the data as if you were using a table manipulation program like say exel. It also has a logger class that will log your movement to a .txt file. It has several corresponding .txt file so please include all.

**!! Please run as g++ -std=c++11**

**[1/14/2019]** Bug found within the chaining attributes for collision. Need to find a better way to integrate. 

**[1/16/2019]** Bug found when trying to delete the entire column

**[1/17/2019]** Trouble when using auto, switch most usage of auto into reg. for-loop, unless it's only printing.

**[1/20/2019]** WRITE() in database_.cpp is written and up and running. The database class needs aditional error checking for user input control. It is running how I intended it to run.
