 DataBase system - 12/28/2018

This is essentially a text manipulation program. It takes in a text file that's formatted to look like a table. 
Then through the program it will give you the ability to manipulate the data as if you were using a table manipulation program like say exel. It also has a looger class that will log your movement to a .txt file. It has several corresponding .txt file so please include all.

This system isn't fully complete. The only class that isn't fully functional is the Database class. Everything else should work properly. 

!! Please run as g++ -std=c++11 and also take off the header "pch.h" because it's a Visual Studio element !!
