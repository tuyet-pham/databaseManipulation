This is essentially a text manipulation program. It takes in a text file that's formatted to look like a table. 
Then through the program it will give you the ability to manipulate the data as if you were using a tabkle manipulation program like say exel. 

This system is not done, please don't try to run it. What you can do though is make your own database class, an item class and a table class to work with the main function! Than you can run it. :)

!! Please run as g++ -std=c++11 and also take off the header "pch.h" because it's a Visual Studio element !!
